    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta (preferably spaghetti)</li>
        <li>Pancetta or guanciale (Italian cured pork cheek) </li>
        <li>Eggs - 4 large (Adjust fro amount of pasta and use only yolks for a richer sauce)</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Pecorino Romano cheese </li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper - to taste</li>
        <li>Salt - for pasta water</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley (optional) - for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente (usually about 8-10 minutes, but check the package instructions). Reserve about a cup of pasta water before draining.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Sauce: While the pasta is cooking, whisk together the egg yolks, Parmesan, and Pecorino cheese in a bowl. Add a generous amount of black pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook the Pancetta/Guanciale: In a large skillet, cook the pancetta or guanciale over medium heat until it's crispy and the fat is rendered. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Combine Pasta and Pancetta: Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the pancetta/guanciale. Toss to coat the pasta in the fat.</li>
        <li>Add Egg and Cheese Mixture: Remove the skillet from the heat. Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, stirring rapidly. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs but be sure to keep stirring to prevent scrambling. Add a little reserved pasta water if the sauce is too thick.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve immediately, garnished with more grated cheese, black pepper, and optional parsley.</li>
