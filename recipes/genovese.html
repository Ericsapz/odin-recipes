    <p>
        Pasta Genovese is a traditional Italian dish, originating from Naples. It's known for its rich, onion-based sauce and is usually served with pasta like ziti or rigatoni. Here's how to make it:
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta (ziti, rigatoni, or similar) - 400 grams</li>
        <li>Beef chuck or brisket - 500 grams, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>Onions - 6 large, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Carrots - 2, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Celery stalks - 2, finely chopped</li>
        <li>White wine - 1/2 cup</li>
        <li>Olive oil - 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper - to taste</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese - for serving</li>
        <li>Fresh basil or parsley (optional) - for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown the Meat: In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the beef chunks, season with salt and pepper, and brown them on all sides. Remove the beef and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the Vegetables: In the same pot, add the sliced onions, carrots, and celery. Cook over low heat until the onions are caramelized and golden brown, which may take up to an hour.</li>
        <li>Add Meat and Wine: Once the onions are caramelized, add the browned beef back to the pot along with the white wine. Scrape the bottom of the pot to deglaze and pick up any flavorful bits.</li>
        <li>Simmer the Sauce: Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer gently for about 2 hours or until the meat is very tender and the flavors are well blended. The sauce should have a thick, onion-heavy consistency. Shred the meat into the sauce.</li>
        <li>Cook the Pasta: While the sauce is in its final stages of simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until al dente, then drain it, reserving some pasta water.</li>
        <li>Combine Pasta and Sauce: Toss the cooked pasta with the Genovese sauce, adding a bit of the reserved pasta water if necessary to loosen the sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve hot, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil or parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
