    <p>
        Pesto is a versatile and aromatic sauce originating from Genoa, Italy. It's traditionally made with fresh basil, garlic, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil. Here's how to make classic basil pesto:
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves - 2 cups, packed</li>
        <li>Garlic - 2 cloves</li>
        <li>Pine nuts - 1/3 cup (you can also use walnuts or almonds as alternatives)</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese - 1/2 cup, freshly grated</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil - 1/2 to 3/4 cup</li>
        <li>Salt - to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper - to taste</li>
        <li>Lemon juice (optional) - a few drops for added brightness</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Basil: Rinse the basil leaves in cold water and gently pat them dry with a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Toast the Nuts (Optional): For added flavor, lightly toast the pine nuts in a dry skillet over medium heat until golden, stirring frequently. Let them cool.</li>
        <li>Blend Ingredients: In a food processor or blender, combine the basil leaves, garlic, and pine nuts. Pulse until coarsely chopped.</li>
        <li>Add Cheese and Seasonings: Add the grated Parmesan cheese to the mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pulse a few more times to mix.</li>
        <li>Emulsify with Olive Oil: With the processor running, gradually add the olive oil in a steady stream until the pesto reaches your desired consistency. You may need more or less oil depending on the size of the basil leaves and your personal preference.</li>
        <li>Adjust the Flavor: Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. If you like, add a few drops of lemon juice to brighten the flavors.</li>
        <li>Use or Store: Use the pesto immediately with pasta, as a spread for bread, or as a condiment. If storing, place it in a jar and cover the top with a thin layer of olive oil, then seal and refrigerate. It can also be frozen for longer storage.</li>
    </ol>
